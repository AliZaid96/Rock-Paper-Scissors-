# Rock Paper Scissors
Rock paper scissors is a game that i was inspired to code using Javascript, it's fascinating to see how Javascript works with basic knowledge! It only excites me more to know how much i could add it, and discover more mechanics and functions to work with.

## Features
The game features 3 buttons to click, rock, paper or scissors. Game rules are basic, whatever you choose the computer will random a choice based on chances, then the score will be decided. Who beats who! Humans or Computers.

### The Game Area

This section allows the user to choose between 3 options, and based on that the result will be decided.

Is it possible to predict computer behaviour? its a 33% chance to win, lose or draw.
